## Skills

I have a diverse background, initially working as a freelance Creative Pattern Cutter with previous experience in customer service and logistics. Despite my non-digital background, I've proactively embraced a transition into the tech industry. I've supplemented my knowledge through self-learning and relevant short courses, leveraging skills acquired from previous training and employment. My practical experience in fashion production has sparked a genuine interest in software development, particularly in utilizing various CAD software tools. This journey has highlighted my adaptability and commitment to continuous learning.

## Communication

Effective communication has been a cornerstone of my professional journey. As a freelance pattern cutter, I've regularly bridged communication gaps between different teams, ensuring alignment between designers and manufacturing companies while meeting client specifications. My foundation in retail provided essential communication skills, fostering positive interactions with customers and colleagues from the outset of my career.

These communication skills have been invaluable in my transition to software development. For instance, I recently conducted a session for my mentees, who were new to coding, where I explained how to use mocks to enhance unit test isolation. Feedback highlighted my ability to convey complex topics effectively, helping others grasp potentially confusing concepts.

## Problem-Solving

I possess strong problem-solving abilities cultivated throughout my professional journey. This skill set was particularly evident during my time as a Freelance Pattern Cutter, where I routinely tackled intricate pattern-related challenges. I applied creative problem-solving techniques, often having to createmore samples or testing fabrics to solve problems and often re-addressing clients needs, optimizing design and production processes. Whether resolving fitting issues or devising innovative solutions for complex pattern modifications, I consistently approach problems with a solution-oriented mindset. I recognised these skills whilst on the software engineering bootcamp and was able to put it to play with planning and TDD practices.

## Team Collaboration and Leadership

Team collaboration and leadership have been instrumental in my recent transition to software development. Working on diverse projects during my software development bootcamp, I excelled in team environments, actively participating in daily stand-ups and retrospectives being able to effectively communicate in my team whilst making others comfortable to voice there opinions. My contributions and receptiveness to feedback enhanced overall team performance, emphasizing my teamwork and leadership capabilities.
