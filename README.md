## Skills
I am currently a freelance Creative Pattern Cutter with previous work experience in customer service and logistics. As my previous experience and training are not from a digital background, I have taken a proactive approach to aid this transition by self-learning and participating in short courses I feel I have relevant skills from my previous training and employment that can be re-directed to aid in this journey.  My experience with the practical side of fashion production has provided insight into an interest in software development using various CAD software, I found that I enjoyed this side of my work and wanted to discover more about the digital industry.
  I am adept with project management skills being able to solve problems in technical construction and computer data input. Which I feel are all transferable skills.


#### Communication
I honed my communication skills whilst working as a freelance pattern cutter, I often have to comunicate between diffent teams from the designer to the manufacturing companies to make sure all the different specifications match up and my clients needs are met. Also working in retail initially gave me a great foundation for this liasing with customers and collegues from the start of my employment history.
   My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.
